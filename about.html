    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section class="about-text">
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Elham Hosseinzadeh</strong>, an Iranian visual artist and code artist born in 1984. I hold a Master's degree in Painting from <strong>Art University of Isfahan</strong>, where I graduated top of my class.
      </p>

      <p>
        My artistic journey bridges traditional visual arts and computational creativity. I create generative art and experimental visuals using <strong>Processing</strong>, a programming language made for artists and designers. Through code, I explore abstract representations of memory, transformation, and inner emotional landscapes.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work has been selected by juries in several art competitions and featured in two online exhibitions. I’ve also authored multiple academic articles on visual culture and contemporary art practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, combining painting and code isn’t just a technical approach — it’s a philosophy. Code allows me to translate the invisible — emotions, shifts in perception, unconscious rhythms — into dynamic, evolving visuals. It’s like painting with logic and light, turning the canvas into a living process.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in poetic technology — the idea that code can be just as expressive, mysterious, and beautiful as a brushstroke. My practice seeks to blur the line between the human and the algorithmic, the intuitive and the calculated.
